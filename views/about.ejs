                    Hello there! I'm Kaitie Kelly, the creator and voice behind
                    'Simply Kaitie'. I'm a 32-year-old mom of two amazing boys,
                    ages 6 and 4, and I've been happily married for 12 years.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Before embracing the full-time role of a stay-at-home mom, I
                    had the incredible opportunity to be a teacher. Teaching has
                    always been a passion of mine, and though I'm no longer in
                    the classroom every day, I occasionally step in as a
                    substitute, connecting with students and sharing my love for
                    learning. <br />
                    <br />
                    'Simply Kaitie' is my corner of the internet where I wear
                    many hatsâ€”mom, wife, teacher, and blogger. Here, I share
                    insights, experiences, and tips on various aspects of life.
                    Whether you're looking for ways to declutter your space,
                    whip up delicious and family-friendly recipes, stay active
                    with fitness routines, or manage your budget effectively,
                    I've got you covered.
